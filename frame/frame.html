<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>This the homepage that I created for my online endeavors!
  Admittedly I don't intend on putting a whole lot on this site at the moment,
  but I do wish to host my comic here once it starts up! There's also a 
  blog here if you care about my thoughts on things, and the about me section 
  talks more about who I am in specific! Thank you for visiting!
