Hello!

This is a personal website project of mine, dedicated to my general online presence.

At the moment it's just a static home page, but I intend on adding blog features, embedding my Twitch streams into it, hosting my webcomic and art on it, and so on.

Deployed to [maddy.lol](https://maddy.lol/) via GitHub Pages!
