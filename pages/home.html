      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>
        This the homepage that I created for my online endeavors!
        Admittedly I don't intend on putting a whole lot on this site at the moment,
        but I do wish to host my comic here once it starts up! There's also a 
        blog here if you care about my thoughts on things, and the about me section 
        talks more about who I am in specific! Thank you for visiting!
