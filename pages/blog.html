    <h1>BLOG!</h1>

      <br>
      I've been on and off working on this site for a little more than a week, maybe close to two, 
      and I'm starting to see what I want finally come to fruition even if it's still got a WAYS to go.
      Hell, I don't even have a navigation thing built yet for these blog posts. I'll get to it when I 
      go to make a second one LOL. 
      <br>
      <br>
      That said though, I'm honestly proud of myself for sticking with this. 
      Whenever this site is in a state that I feel 
      comfortable with, I'll probably start up work on my creative endeavours again because having a place
       all to my own to host my stuff on is a serious motivator. I heavily dislike how cookie cutter everything 
       is around the internet these days and having a place that feels all my own again is probably the 
       biggest motivator I could have possible been given. 
       <br>
       <br>
       Anyways, I hope whoever's reading this has a 
       good rest of their night because it's 12:25 AM as of typing this update. Cya!
