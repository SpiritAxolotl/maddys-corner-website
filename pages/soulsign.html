    <h1>SOULSIGN!</h1>
    <p>
      Soulsign is, honestly, a silly little self indulgent idea that I had for a comic
      that fuses things that I personally really enjoy like battle shonen, internet 
      art styles of old, and so on.  It follows brothers Theo and Paul as they and their 
      friends find themselves entrenched in an ongoing mystery that's enveloping their small town. 

      <br>
      <br>

      I originally envisioned the plot as something that you'd see in a RPG, but dialed it back a bit 
      and combined the idea with characters and ideas that I had for a web cartoon akin to Eddsworld 
      to create what I know refer to as Soulsign. I can't exactly give an estimate for when I'll 
      be done ironing out small details for consistency's sake, but I'll link to the comic here once 
      I've got it up and going!

      Have an image that I've drawn of Theo and Paul + the first page of the comic itself.
