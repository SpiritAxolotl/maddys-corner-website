    <h1>ABOUT!</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Maddy, and I'm an artist in her mid 20's! 
      I've been creating stuff for as long as I can remember,
      most of which being just straight up visual art. I've also been
      posting online for most of my life, for better and worse.
       I made this site because I wanted my own small little slice of the internet
      and no currently hosted social media does exactly what social media of 
      old used to do. That's about it really, I hope you enjoy browsing what's on 
      here as I post more and more here!
